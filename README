Saras - Finite-difference solver

Saras is an MPI parallelized Navier-Stokes solver written in C++.
It uses finite-difference methods for spatial discretization along with parallelized algebraic multi-grid method for solving
the pressure correction equation.

All the source and library files for the Saras solver are contained in the following directories:
./src/ - contains all the different solvers available in Saras
./lib/ - contains all the libraries used by the solvers in ./src/ folder
./install/ - contains the installation scripts to build and compile the solver
./output/ - the solution files written by the solver are contained in this folder,
            and it is an empty directory as far as Git is concerned since it doesn't track any of the files in it.

Prerequisites:
    blitz - All array manipulations are done by the blitz library
    cmake - Necessary to make the executable from the source files
    mpich - The compiler used is mpic++
    yaml - The input parameters are stored in the parameters.yaml file which needs the yaml library to parse.
    hdf5 - The output files are written in HDF5 format and requires the HDF5 library

To compile and run the solver, run the compileSaras.sh shell script in the install directory
