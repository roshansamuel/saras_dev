Measure the memory footprints of all the arrays
Calculation of nu and kappa for scalar runs is taking place both in timestep.cc as well as scalar.cc - this redundancy must be removed.
The computation of non-linear terms may require some extra interpolation weights when performed on non-uniform grid. This must be rigorously checked.
In the iterative solvers for U, V, W and T, it might be better (and faster) to compare with previous solution rather than RHS for convergence.
The Doxygen documentation in many of the older libraries (esp field) is very outdated and mentions the use of pointers where references are being used now. The docs must be updated.
Parallelize spiral LES code
Update checkLDC.py script so that data is interpolated properly before plotting
