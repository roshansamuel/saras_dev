Current implementation of obtaining global grid for all MPI sub-domains works only for uniform grid - write a generalized function that uses MPI broadcast instead of computing individually and repeatedly
Measure the memory footprints of all the arrays
Implement circular heating plate for RBC
Add a routine in grid class to write the grid coordinates for plotting of non-uniform data
Replace all timing calls for scaling with MPI_wtime as it is more reliable for parallel run timing
